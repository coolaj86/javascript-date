====

    require("date");
    var datestr = "2009-10-03T17:44:12.117Z+10:30";
    console.log(datestr === Date.ISO(datestr).toISOString());

Adapted from [ECMAScript ISO Date For Every Browser](http://webreflection.blogspot.com/2009/07/ecmascript-iso-date-for-every-browser.html)

Extends the `Date` prototype to work for [ISO 96001 (RFC 3339)](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) dates

    Year:
      YYYY (eg 1997)
    Year and month:
      YYYY-MM (eg 1997-07)
    Complete date:
      YYYY-MM-DD (eg 1997-07-16)
    Complete date plus hours and minutes:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20+01:00)
    Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00)
    Complete date plus hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal fraction of a second
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00)

    where:

      YYYY = four-digit year
      MM   = two-digit month (01=January, etc.)
      DD   = two-digit day of month (01 through 31)
      hh   = two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed)
      mm   = two digits of minute (00 through 59)
      ss   = two digits of second (00 through 59)
      s    = one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second
      TZD  = time zone designator (Z or +hh:mm or -hh:mm)
